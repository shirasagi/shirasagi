Description:
    Stubs out a new migration.

Example:
    `rails generate ss_migration fix_thing --module cms`

    This will create:
        lib/migrations/cms/${NEXT_MIGRATION_VERSION}_fix_thing.rb
        spec/lib/migrations/cms/${NEXT_MIGRATION_VERSION}_fix_thing_spec.rb

    Note:
        ${NEXT_MIGRATION_VERSION} will detect and set automatically.
        You don't need to specify ${NEXT_MIGRATION_VERSION}.
