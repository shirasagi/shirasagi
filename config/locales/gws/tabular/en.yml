      ##### About the CSV / ZIP
      - Please obtain the CSV or ZIP file for import from Downloads.

      ##### About Attachments
      - When uploading data that includes attachments, please compress the CSV file and attachments together into one ZIP file and import the ZIP file.
      - Only CSV files can be imported if attachments are not included.

      ##### About the columns in the CSV
      - The ID column is required. The ID column represents an internal ID. An empty row in the ID column is always imported as a new record, and a row with the ID column set updates an existing record. If the record in the ID column is not found, it is imported as a new record.
      - All columns except the ID column can be deleted from the CSV. Removing columns that are not to be imported prevents unnecessary or unintended changes.
      
      ##### About columns that cannot be imported
      - Lookup type items cannot be imported. During import, if the reference type data is changed, the corresponding lookup type data is automatically changed.
      - The following columns cannot be imported:
        - 申請日時列
        - 申請コメント列
        - 承認状態列
        - ステータス列
        - マイグレーションエラー列
        - 更新日時列
        - 作成日時列
        There may be other columns that cannot be imported due to system reasons.
      
      ##### Restrictions
      - Even if you download the CSV with the language setting “English,” the content of the downloaded CSV will be in Japanese, and only Japanese CSV can be imported.
    new_form_notice_md: |-
      Click on the appropriate entry button in the toolbar to complete the creation of %{name}.
      
      ##### How to create
      - You can add an entry at the top by clicking on the button in the top toolbar.
      - You can also add an entry at the bottom by clicking on the button in the bottom toolbar.

      ##### Notes on the first entry
      - The first entry should be set to a text type that is unique.
      - Non-unique or non-text type input items may cause problems with CSV import. In particular, when importing a reference type, if the first input item in the reference is not unique, it cannot be imported correctly.
    no_reference_fields: “The reference column has not been added. To use the lookup, you must first add the reference column and set it appropriately.”

        - Selecting “None” will check permissions each time an uploaded file is viewed, which may worsen server performance.
        - Selecting “Export to public” will export files uploaded under the server's public/ folder. This results in better server performance, but also allows unauthorized persons to view the file if they know the URL.
      allowed_extensions:
        - Enter the file extensions for uploadable files.
        - Multiple file formats can be specified by separating the file extensions with a space.
